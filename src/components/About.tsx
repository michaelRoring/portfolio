        <p className="mt-2">
          At the end of 2022, I quit my job as a software engineer to go
          fulltime into building and scaling my own SaaS businesses. In the
          past, I pursued a double degree in computer science and business,
          interned at big tech companies in Silicon Valley, and competed in over
          21 hackathons for fun. I also had the pleasure of being a part of the
          first ever in-person cohort of buildspace called buildspace sf1.
